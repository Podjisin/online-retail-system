an ORS system im making for a school project with my classmates

# Note

I'm honestly not sure how people structure their projects, so I'll just do whatever put both in one repository. Backend and Frontend will be in their own folders. I will just try to keep commits as clean as possible.

- Backend
- Fronted (GUI)
  - Staff App
  - User App

I decided to use VueJS + Vuetify in this project as its a painless framework to use.
